$description = "PoShMon is an open source PowerShell-based server and farm monitoring solution. It's an 'agent-less' monitoring tool, which means there's nothing that needs to be installed on any of the environments you want to monitor - you can simply run or schedule the script from a regular workstation and have it monitor a single server or group of servers, using PowerShell remoting. PoShMon is also able to monitor 'farm'-based products like SharePoint, in which multiple servers work together to provide a single platform.

Key Features
Some of the key features / benefits of PoShMon are:
- Agent-less Monitoring - nothing needs to be installed on the remote servers
- Core operating system and web-site monitoring
- Specialized SharePoint monitoring
- Specialized Office Online Server monitoring
- Supports frequent/critical as well as comprehensive daily monitoring
- Email, Pushbullet (mobile), Office 365 Teams ('Chat-ops') and Twilio (SMS) notifications
- Provides a framework for 'self-healing' systems
- Support for Operation Validation Framework (OVF)
